<h3>Who doesn't hate politics?</h3>

<p>Probably just some power hungry freaks and those with vested interests.</p>

<p>Politics really isn't my thing. I keep talking about it because the public is not caring enough. You might want to say that it is the influentials caring too less. That is exactly a statement I have said and it probably earned me some hatred. But the thing is, if they do not care, or if it is precisely against their interests, then who will take care of it, if not us?</p>

<p>Tragedies have already happened, think about the autocracies and the people around the world, for example, the Uyghurs. As we advance in technology, more and worse are happening, because those with power and wealth are the ones who can utilize or more appropriately, abuse the new techs.</p>

<p>One of the main problem is that we tend to think that things will not be so crazy, but the fact is, many crazes are already happening in ways that do not trigger a rapid reaction from us.</p>

<p>If we do not start caring, we migth not be able to do anything about it later.</p>

<p>I am saying this, because I am not able to help myself now.</p>

<p>You might find that it is hard to do anything meaningful even if you start now.</p>
