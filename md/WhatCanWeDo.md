### TLDR: What is meaningless is to say that it is meaningless and do nothing.
**I do not advocate donation and sponsorship. It is easy for exploitation by those who forget what they stood for and those who exploit everything to begin with. Unless you are sure it will be put into good use. I suggest saving your resources and make use of them yourselves.

## What can we do
Do however little we can. Each of us are powerless poor common people. It is tempting to say "what can I do?" and leave the problem to the next, but isn't it exactly why we are still facing the problems nowadays?

Never think that your contribution is too small. Allow me to make a suggestion and use it as an example:
## Try to avoid spending on products, including services, from bad sources, such as unscrupulous businesses and autocracies.

Let's say you can only spend 1 cent fewer on bad sources each day on average. It surely seems useless on its own. But there are about 8 billion people in the world. Let's say only 1% of us want a better world and are able to join the cause. It will still be 0.8 millions every day. And it will be 24 millions a month, 292 millions a year.

I am quite sure we can do more than that, but more importantly we can be assured that our efforts will not be meaningless. What is meaningless is to say that it is meaningless and do nothing.

We might not be able to bleed the monsters, but at least we can stop feeding them willingly. We might not be able escape from the suckers, but at least we should make it an effort for them to feed on us.

Now let's encourage ourselves a little bit, what if we can spend 1 fewer dollar everyday? It will be 29.2 billions a year!

Be it 1 dollar or 1 cent. Will you do that to say no to the autocracies?
