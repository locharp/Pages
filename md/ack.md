The are many things that have always been wrong. Often time we would say that's life. Not that I don't agree with that, actually that is a good reaction because it means we acknowledge the existences of problems. What I'd beg to differ is, what we are going to do afterwards.

I am afraid most of the time when we say "that's life", we are actually saying "accept it". Not just in the sense that we should accept it as what is happening, but to accept it as how it should be. If I may be so bold, I'd say that this contributes to a lot of terrible things in our current world.

Often time we would say, what could we do. If we cannot change it, then we can only accept it. We would be better off staying positive than to being depressed by something we cannot change. Yes, and no. We have to move on, but move on doesn't mean accepting bad as good, wrong as right. We ought to keep in mind that something is wrong, and it should be changed.

We would strive to improve our life, to get a better job, to have better food , to have a better place to live. So why shouldn't we strive for a better norm. Of course we do, we are actually doing a lot, for example, equality for races and sexual orientation.

But somehow we seem to have a different attitude towards some other matters.
